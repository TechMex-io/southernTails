In order to keep our best friends in best health, veterinarians
recommend regular grooming of your pet. Not only is the grooming
process necessary for our long-furred friends, it also serves as a quick
body-wellness exam. Overall conditions will be noted during their stay,
and all notes will be reported back to their caretakers. Should any
concerns be reported we then recommend to see your veterinarian.

At Southern Tails, we offer both baths and grooms for dogs. All pups
must present paper documentation showing they are current on their
rabies vaccinations in order to qualify. As much as we love babies, we
don’t recommend them visiting us until they have had their 2nd puppy
shot series in their system for at least 24 hours.
