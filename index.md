Welcome to Southern Tails, an encompassing pet facility that is unique in every way.

Our clients’ pets are part of their families – all deserving of loving attention and individual, customized care. We are committed to providing our clients with exceptional pet care services and products so that we can ensure their pets’ safety, health, and contentment. We promise to treat each client and their pet with dignity and professionalism. Our aim is to positively impact the lives of these pets and their owners by providing outstanding, trustworthy, and professional services. We want to stand out in the local community as the only pet facility with the research, knowledge, compassion, and tools to achieve these goals.

To ensure our mission’s success, we will stand out as a leader in pet-care education. If we promise that our staff is committed to the knowledge, safety, and professionalism, we must back up that claim by endorsing their credentials. We offer state-of-the art education in the pet-care industry. The educational component is two-part; there is course work where students will learn the professional and humane aspects for handling pets. The second component offers a laboratory for students to gain necessary hands-on experience. This is an excellent place for continuing education in a growing industry. Students will receive certificates upon completion, which will be valuable tools for further growth in the industry.
